#### Abstract

This code has been devloped to calculate the output of a nuclear physics experiment.
By running multiple computational experiments, a picture is built up to models the output of a real particle detector.
Monte Carlo experiments like this can be used to understand a problem by repetition and are applicable to financial problems, physics simulations, and numerous other applications.
